# FormulaOneOne
Available in BigBoss, it was originally made to make Electra jailbreak run smoother in Cydia, add a simple but cool UI customization, and firmware faker. It picks random colors and adds them to all styles of activity indicators inside Cydia, including status bar. 

The current version has tons of segment cells full of coloring and other ways to alter the UI of Cydia.It also replaces the loading text with random quotes, jokes and oddities if desired.

The tweak works on all devices from iOS 9-12.4. (Need to update makefiles for A12 tho)



About to add backgrouding to further speed up loading sources, and optimize the way settings are handled.
