# CydiaFormulaOneOne
Recently submitted to BigBoss, makes Electra jailbreak run smoother in Cydia and has a neat UI customization and firmware faker. It picks random colors and adds them to all styles of activity indicators inside Cydia, includimg status bar.  May
later add color picker option for each style.

The firmware faker and UI change to Cydia works on all devices iOS 9-11.1.2, tested on 9.3.3, 10.0.1 and 11.1.2
Electra patch to get rid of errors from blocking saurik's repo amd some bad code signatures mainly targeted at iOS 11 but sho
shouldnt hurt having it on lower firmwares.
